# Gravity No-Slip Billiards

### Math Modeling: A study of ergodicity of differently shaped billiards

### Authors: Jurgen Xhafaj, Dr. Christopher Cox

We consider a relatively new type of billiards that has attracted interest in the recent years in the mathematics community: no-slip billiards. Our project is focused on a slim vertical strip where a theoretical point-mass object bounces from one pole to the other. The goal of this project is to visually prove that the simulation will result in a bounded section of this space, even after a large number of bounces.

Our project started from scratch and includes 5 main stages of implementation:

* Rectangle and Circle (specular) billiards
* General Polygons (specular) billiards
* Phase Portraits for billiard
* No-Slip Collisions 
* Gravity Billiards (no-slip)

Credit for the idea of no-slip billiards goes to Dr. Christopher Cox and Dr. Renato Feres (see link below for their paper).
