### Billiards
Math Modeling: A study of ergodicity of differently shaped billiards

Authors: Jurgen Xhafaj, Dr. Christopher Cox

We consider a relatively new type of billiards that has attracted interest in the recent years in the mathematics community: no-slip billiards. Our project is focused on a slim vertical strip where a theoretical point-mass object bounces from one pole to the other. The goal of this project is to visually prove that the simulation will result in a bounded section of this space, even after a large number of bounces.
